# SAP-1 Microcomputer

## Overview
The SAP-1 (Simple-As-Possible 1) microcomputer is an elementary educational computer model designed to introduce basic computer architecture and operation principles. It is a simplified representation of a working computer system, making it ideal for learning and teaching purposes.

## Key Components

### Program Counter (PC)
- Keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed.

### Memory Address Register (MAR)
- Holds the address of the memory location to be accessed.

### Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Stores the program instructions and data.

### Instruction Register (IR)
- Holds the current instruction being executed.

### Control Unit (CU)
- Decodes instructions and generates control signals to manage the operation of other components.

### Accumulator (ACC)
- A register used for arithmetic and logic operations.

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.

### Output Register (OUT)
- Stores the result of operations and outputs data.

### Bus
- A communication system that transfers data between components.

## Operation Cycle

### Fetch
- The program counter (PC) sends the address of the next instruction to the memory address register (MAR), which then retrieves the instruction from RAM.

### Decode
- The instruction is placed in the instruction register (IR) and decoded by the control unit (CU) to generate the necessary control signals.

### Execute
- The control signals direct the appropriate components to perform the required operations, such as arithmetic calculations or data transfer.

## Significance
The SAP-1 microcomputer provides a foundational understanding of how a basic computer operates, covering essential concepts such as instruction cycles, data flow, and the interaction between different computer components. It serves as a stepping stone for more advanced studies in computer architecture and microprocessor design.
